## Technology Used
The Zania Frontend uses **React.js, TailwindCSS, Jotai, and MSW**.

## How It's Organized
The code is structured using the Atomic Design method, which helps keep everything organized and easy to manage.

## What It Can Do
### 1. Handling Data
The app can fetch and update data using MSW and local storage. Changes persist even if the page is refreshed.

### 2. Drag-and-Drop
Users can easily move things around with drag-and-drop functionality, thanks to React-DND.

### 3. Loading Images Smoothly
Images load smoothly with a placeholder and spinner until they're fully loaded.

### 4. Viewing Media
Clicking on an image displays it in a larger view with the card's info. Users can close it by pressing ESC or clicking the "X" icon.
